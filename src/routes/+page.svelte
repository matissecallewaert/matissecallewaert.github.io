			<p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
				I am a software developer based in Belgium, holding a master's degree in Information
				Technology from the University of Ghent. Throughout my academic journey, I worked at a WaaS
				company and undertook an internship at a consultancy, gaining valuable practical experience.
				Driven by a passion for continuous learning and exploration, I thrive on delving into coding
				projects with my colleagues to unleash our creativity. Outside the world of technology, I
				find joy in sports and collaborative coding endeavors that allow us to push the boundaries
				of our imagination.
